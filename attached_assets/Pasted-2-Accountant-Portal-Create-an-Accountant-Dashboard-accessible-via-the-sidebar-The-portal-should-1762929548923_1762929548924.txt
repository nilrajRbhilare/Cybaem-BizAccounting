2️⃣ Accountant Portal

Create an Accountant Dashboard accessible via the sidebar.

The portal should allow switching between:

Client List View: Sidebar displays a scrollable list of clients with quick info (name, balance, last invoice).

Reports View: Main section shows analytics (bar charts, pie charts, and tables for income/expenses per client).

Include a toggle switch or tabs to swap between “Clients” and “Reports”.

Each client can be clicked to open a detailed financial summary (popup or nested page).

The layout should be 2-column on desktop and stacked on mobile.

📱 Responsiveness:

All pages and modals should adapt seamlessly to screen sizes:

Mobile: stacked layout, floating CTAs

Tablet: two-column

Desktop: grid dashboard layout

Navigation sidebar should collapse into a top navbar or hamburger menu on small screens.

Charts and tables should remain scrollable on smaller viewports.

🧭 Additional UI Features:

Sticky top navbar with app name and profile dropdown.

Global search bar for invoices, clients, or reports.

Use subtle animations (Framer Motion) when switching tabs or views.

Include reusable Button, Card, Modal, and Form components for consistency.

Make sure UI components use Tailwind utility classes for maintainability.
