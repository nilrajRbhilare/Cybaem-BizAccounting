Build a modern, responsive web application UI for a business invoicing and accounting system using React (with Tailwind CSS).

The app should look professional, clean, and highly interactive, optimized for both desktop and mobile.

Use consistent color themes for all buttons, navigation, and cards — make the colors intuitive (e.g., blue for primary actions, green for confirm, red for delete).
Add smooth hover transitions, rounded corners, and soft shadows to make the interface feel dynamic and pleasant.

🎨 Design Guidelines:

Primary color palette: shades of blue and gray, with accent colors for CTA (e.g., teal, amber).

Buttons:

Primary: Blue background, white text, hover → darker blue

Secondary: Gray outline, hover → light blue background

Danger: Red background, white text

Typography: Use modern sans-serif (like Inter or Poppins).

Use grid layouts for dashboards and cards for content blocks.

Add a sidebar for navigation (collapsible on mobile).

Keep UI responsive — use media queries or Tailwind’s responsive classes.

⚙️ Functional Requirements:
1️⃣ Mobile Quick Invoice Flow

Implement a 3-step mobile-friendly invoice creation flow:

Step 1: Client Details (name, contact, select from existing or add new)

Step 2: Add Items

Include a “Scan to Add Item” feature (mocked for now with a button that triggers an upload or barcode input modal).

Show a floating “+ Add Item” or “+ Invoice” CTA button on the bottom-right of mobile view.

Step 3: Review & Confirm (summary of items, taxes, total amount, “Confirm Invoice” button)

Each step should be a card-based layout with progress indicators at the top (e.g., Step 1 of 3).

Mobile-first, one card per screen.

Smooth transitions between steps.

2️⃣ Accountant Portal

Create an Accountant Dashboard accessible via the sidebar.

The portal should allow switching between:

Client List View: Sidebar displays a scrollable list of clients with quick info (name, balance, last invoice).

Reports View: Main section shows analytics (bar charts, pie charts, and tables for income/expenses per client).

Include a toggle switch or tabs to swap between “Clients” and “Reports”.

Each client can be clicked to open a detailed financial summary (popup or nested page).

The layout should be 2-column on desktop and stacked on mobile.

📱 Responsiveness:

All pages and modals should adapt seamlessly to screen sizes:

Mobile: stacked layout, floating CTAs

Tablet: two-column

Desktop: grid dashboard layout

Navigation sidebar should collapse into a top navbar or hamburger menu on small screens.

Charts and tables should remain scrollable on smaller viewports.

🧭 Additional UI Features:

Sticky top navbar with app name and profile dropdown.

Global search bar for invoices, clients, or reports.

Use subtle animations (Framer Motion) when switching tabs or views.

Include reusable Button, Card, Modal, and Form components for consistency.

Make sure UI components use Tailwind utility classes for maintainability.
