I want to build a Vyapar App–like Billing and Accounting Web Application using React, local JSON data, and no backend.

The app should be responsive, modern, and designed for small businesses to manage invoices, inventory, expenses, and reports — similar to Vyapar or Zoho Books UI.

Use React functional components, Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext), and React Router for navigation. Store and fetch all data from local JSON files or browser storage (localStorage) to simulate backend operations.

🧩 Tech Stack & Libraries

React 18+

React Router DOM (for navigation)

Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap 5 (for responsive UI)

Chart.js or Recharts (for analytics and dashboard graphs)

Framer Motion (optional for smooth animations)

🧱 Core Pages / Screens

Simulate login with static JSON credentials.

Store “loggedInUser” in localStorage.

Simple email-password validation.

Responsive 2-column layout (left: image, right: form).

Option to switch between Login / Signup tabs.

2️⃣ Company Setup Wizard

Collect company info (Name, GST Number, Bank Details, Address, Logo).

🎨 UI/UX Design Guidelines

Clean, business-style UI similar to Vyapar / Zoho Books.

Left sidebar navigation (Dashboard, Invoices, Inventory, Reports, Settings).

Top bar for notifications, search, and profile menu.

Use pastel color palette (white, blue, grey tones).

Add hover and transition effects for buttons and cards.

100% responsive (mobile-first approach).
